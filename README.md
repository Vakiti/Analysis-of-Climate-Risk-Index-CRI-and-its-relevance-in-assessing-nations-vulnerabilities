# Analysis-of-Climate-Risk-Index-CRI-and-its-relevance-in-assessing-nations-vulnerabilities
The CRI is a measure of the impact of climate change on countries and regions based on climate-related disasters, such as floods, storms, heatwaves, and droughts, over the past two decades. 
It considers factors like the number of deaths, injuries, economic losses, and disruptions to social and economic activities.

The project aims to understand how the CRI score is calculated and the extent of influence each contributing factor has on the score. 
It also explores whether incorporating additional features in the CRI calculation can improve the reliability of the score as a metric. 
Specifically, the project introduces socio-economic features like Environmental Performance Index (EPI) score, population density, and GDP per capita in the analysis.
